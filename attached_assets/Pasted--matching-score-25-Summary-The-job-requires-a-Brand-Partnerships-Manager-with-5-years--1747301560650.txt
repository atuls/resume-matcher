  "Summary": "The job requires a Brand Partnerships Manager with 5+ years of sales experience in influencer marketing, digital media, or advertising who can own the full sales cycle, develop relationships, and have deep knowledge of influencer marketing trends. The candidate is a Namer and Naming Consultant with experience since 1996 in creating names, taglines, and verbal branding.
