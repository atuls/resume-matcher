Her work history consists primarily of roles in sales, childcare, and customer service, without the required marketing leadership experience. The candidate is currently pursuing a Business Degree in Management at Colorado Mesa University but does not have the extensive experience in digital advertising, SEO, content marketing, and conversion rate optimization required for the position. While she has some skills in sales, prospecting, and lead generation, she lacks the depth of experience in growth marketing strategies, paid media campaigns, and data-driven decision-making needed for this role.",
