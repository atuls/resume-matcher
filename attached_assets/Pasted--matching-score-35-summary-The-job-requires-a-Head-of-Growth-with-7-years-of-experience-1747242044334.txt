  "summary": "The job requires a Head of Growth with 7+ years of experience in growth marketing, digital marketing, or demand generation, with at least 3 years in a leadership role. The candidate, Olivia DeSpirito, is a recent graduate with primarily retail and hospitality experience. She has limited marketing experience from her internship at CMU Athletics & Recreation, but no demonstrated growth marketing, digital marketing leadership, or demand generation expertise. While she has some relevant skills like communication and teamwork, she lacks the technical marketing skills, analytics experience, and leadership background required for this senior role. Her education in Media Strategies and Applications is relevant, but cannot compensate for the lack of professional marketing experience and leadership background required for this position.",
