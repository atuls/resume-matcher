# Head of Growth 

## About Us

We are a fast-growing influencer marketing agency specializing in data-driven campaigns. Our strategies leverage industry insights, social listening, and analytics to guide creative decisions. Then, we let the results take it from there-each strategic move is influenced by top-performing influencers and content.

Everyone claims to be data-backed, but we prove it using our Optimization Flywheel, driving brands to exponentially higher ROI. Some of our recent achievements include:

- Outperforming paid lower-funnel agencies by 5 x in conversions.
- Achieving 500x above TikTok's ad benchmarks in watch time.
- Ranking \#2 globally on TikTok's leaderboard for an entire month.


## Role Overview

As the Head of Growth, you will be responsible for increasing the volume and quality of inbound leads while enhancing brand visibility across key channels. This role requires a balance of data-driven strategy, creative marketing execution, and cross-functional collaboration. You will oversee demand generation, content strategy, partnerships, and paid media to drive sustainable growth.

You will own the strategy for our acquisition efforts, ensuring that our brand presence scales and translates into meaningful business opportunities. This includes identifying new channels for growth, optimizing existing ones, and ensuring a continuous feedback loop to improve performance over time.

## Key Responsibilities

## Lead Generation \& Demand Generation

- Develop and execute multi-channel strategies (organic, paid, partnerships) to consistently increase the number of high-quality inbound leads.
- Implement and optimize paid media campaigns (Google, Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn) for lead acquisition and brand awareness.
- Leverage SEO, content marketing, and CRO techniques to drive traffic and improve conversion rates.
- Build and optimize lead nurturing workflows to ensure effective lead qualification
- Develop and improve our lead lifecycle (clearly define MQLs, SQLs, etc.) so we can track demand gen performance objectively and accurately
- Improve our current ROAS and ensure clear attribution to channels and spend
- Test and iterate via landing page and website optimizations to improve website and form conversion


## Brand Visibility \& Awareness

- Own and enhance the company's brand positioning through thought leadership, PR, and strategic partnerships.
- Work with content and creative teams to develop high-performing campaigns across digital and social media.
- Develop influencer and industry relationships to amplify brand credibility and reach.
- Experiment with emerging marketing channels and strategies to stay ahead of industry trends.
- Gain industry recognition via award submissions, securing wins, and getting invited to keynote at major conferences.
- Be an expert at gaining earned media (i.e. maximizing reach and awareness via creative strategies vs. relying solely on pay-to-play opportunities)


## Customer Retention \& Expansion

- Work closely with Account Management to develop strategies for increasing retention and customer lifetime value (LTV).
- Implement automated lead nurturing programs that drive upsells and cross-sells.
- Analyze customer behavior post-sale to optimize onboarding and engagement strategies.


## Growth Analytics \& Optimization

- Implement data-driven approaches to measure, analyze, and improve marketing performance.
- Establish KPIs and build dashboards to track performance across all acquisition channels.
- Continuously test and iterate growth strategies based on data insights.
- Conduct competitive analysis to identify new growth opportunities.
- Gain a detailed understanding of where our leads are finding us and what their path to purchase looks like.
- Analyze drop-off rates on the demo signup page and identify ways to improve these KPIs.
- Report on these KPIs in our weekly meetings.


## Product-Led Growth \& Experimentation

- Identify and remove friction points in the customer journey to drive conversions.
- Run A/B tests on acquisition and retention strategies to determine the most effective approaches.
- Leverage referral programs and viral loops to drive organic growth.


## Website \& Social Media Optimization

- Keep web pages updated to reflect our value proposition and offerings.
- Create new landing pages tailored to different services to optimize conversions and engagement.
- Leverage AI-driven personalization to tailor content and experiences to different audience segments.


## Partnerships \& Community Building

- Identify and develop partnerships that can expand our reach and drive lead acquisition.
- Engage with industry communities and networks to establish the brand as a go-to authority in influencer marketing.
- Develop co-marketing initiatives with complementary brands to reach new audiences.
- Collaborate with sales and account management teams to ensure alignment between marketing efforts and business goals.

# Cross-Department Collaboration \& Leadership 

- Lead as a player-coach, getting your own hands in the weeds and leading projects from start-to-finish (we're a lean team and our leaders are biased towards actions and minimize delegation where possible)
- Work closely with Sales, Customer Success, and Product teams to ensure alignment between growth initiatives and business goals.
- Ensure acquisition efforts translate into high-quality conversions by optimizing the entire customer journey.
- Collaborate with Finance and Operations to ensure growth initiatives are cost-effective and scalable, in addition to owning our Marketing team's P\&L and annual budget
